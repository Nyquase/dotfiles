# A dmenu script to edit predefined files.

# This implementation works with dotfiles. Could be arbitrary files.

# The full paths are manually included in a plain text file.
# One path per line, starting with the 'label' we want to display in the menu,
# followed by a '=' then the path to the file you want to open
# The file must have the following format :
#
# Examples:
# Bspwm=/home/USERNAME/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc
# Tmux Keybindings=/home/USERNAME/.tmux/keybindings.conf

# Path to dotfiles index

# Keeps only the first part which is the path's label
